Left Field Labs
Front-end Developer Homework Assignment
Variation 1 - Summer 2017



Overview & Goals
------------------------------------
Left Field Labs would like to thank you for taking the time to complete this homework assignment. 

We are a passionate and dedicated group of developers, designers and producers who believe that merely "good enough" is an insufficient standard when it comes to delivering software and interactive experiences for our clients.

As a result we must ensure that developers who work with us are highly functional, fluid and not afraid to take on new challenges. Our internal culture is designed to foster success and growth on a daily basis. We accomplish this by turning to one another and sharing what we know. We've got each others' backs. But this only works if everyone works at the top of their game. 

This homework assignment is a chance for you to demonstrate your excellence and convince us you're ready to work at our level of skill and passion. Things we get excited about: completion, hitting deadlines, attention to details, ability to present your work to others. We look forward to being amazed by your efforts.



Manifest
------------------------------------
1. README.txt (this file)

3. Assets needed for build: assets.zip (note: there are extra assets present that may not be needed for build)




Instructions
------------------------------------
• Create and style a responsive HTML page which matches the REFERENCE.jpg file. Please write your styling code using SCSS and use a common SCSS -> CSS compiler.

• Page should be responsive with one breakpoint for mobile. You are free to stack/reorder/position the content in a way that makes sense for mobile.
